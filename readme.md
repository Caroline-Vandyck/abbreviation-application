 This repository contains the code applied in our contribution to the conference Digital Humanities Benelux 2024, held from June 5-7 in Leuven. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook encompassing the code, a folder with the used data, and a folder with images and plots. 

 This contribution is part of the research project “Silent voices: A Digital Study of the Herne Charterhouse as a Textual Community (ca. 1350-1400)”, funded by the Flemish Research Agency (Belgium) at the University of Antwerp. The project studies the evolution of the scribal culture in the Herne monastery through computational text analysis.
